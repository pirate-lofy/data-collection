# Python package for Carla data collection
Collecting vision data from carla simulator to create a benchmarch for computer vision and deep learning application.
This project is part of my Master's thesis (under development)

## How it works
This is package is meant to contain fully automated scripts that can collect data from Carla Simulator in various maps and weather conditions.
It meant to collect tens of gigabytes of data during sessions that last for tens of hours

## data types
Package can collect 
* rgb 
* sementic segmentation 
* depth images

## TODO
- [x] Add better logging system
- [x] Addind wrappers for supporting multiple cameras
- [x] Adding dynamic weather functionality
- [x] Spawn multiple actors
- [ ] Change maps dynamically
